<h2>How to use?</h2>
<br>

<p>Install Node, Make sure to have minimum version: 16.11.0, Download node from: https://nodejs.org/en/</p>
<p>Open your Command Prompt and CD to the Bot Folder.</p>
<p>Type "npm install" to install required node modules.</p>
<p>Create a new file ".env" without a name.</p>
<p>Edit the file and type "TOKEN=yourbottoken" inside it and save it, make sure you never share your bot token with anybody.</p>
<p>Run the bot by typing "node esportal.js" unless you want to use the typescript version then you can type "ts-node esportal.ts", requires "typescript" and "ts-node", install instructions on the 2nd part of the readme.</p>

<br>

<h2>How to create new commands?</h2>
<br>

<p>Open your preferred code editor, I recommend using Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/</p>
<p>Start by installing typscript and ts-node by typing "npm install -g typescript ts-node" on your command prompt.</p>
<p>Open 2 command prompt instances and type "npm run tsc" in one of them to convert your code to javascript automatically and "npm run dev" on the other one to automatically run and restart your bot when changes have been made.</p>
<p>Please only make commands and changes to the ".ts" files when making new commands or changes to the main bot.</p>
<p>Create new commands into commands folder, you can also create subfolders.</p>
<p>Create new commands such as "commandname.ts" and create your commands using typescript.</p>
